I want to implement the Paste Queue feature for my Aurelia clipboard manager app. This is an advanced feature that lets users copy multiple items in sequence and paste them back in order.
Core Behavior:
Building the Queue:


User activates Queue mode with keyboard shortcut (default: Cmd+Shift+C, customizable in settings)
While in Queue mode, each copy operation (Cmd+C) adds the item to the queue instead of just the history
Items are numbered/ordered in the sequence they were copied
Visual indicator shows Queue mode is active (maybe menu bar icon changes to show queue state)
Pasting from Queue:


Each paste operation (Cmd+V) consumes and pastes the next item in the queue sequence
First paste → item 1, second paste → item 2, etc.
Items are removed from the queue after pasting (or marked as used)
Queue empties when all items have been pasted
User can exit Queue mode manually to return to normal clipboard behavior
Queue Management:


Items can be reordered via drag-and-drop before pasting
Quick "Flip Order" button to reverse the entire queue sequence
Items can be removed from queue individually
Clear entire queue option ("Wash Queue")
Option to convert queue items back to regular history without pasting
Queue Preview Window (Floating Panel):
Window Behavior:


Draggable floating window that appears when Queue mode is activated
Stays on top of other windows but doesn't steal focus
Can be repositioned anywhere on screen - position persists
Semi-transparent/frosted glass aesthetic (Aurelia vibrancy)
Shows all queued items in vertical stack
Visual Design:


Items connected by glowing electric cyan "tentacle" lines showing the flow/order
Each item numbered (1, 2, 3...) showing paste sequence
Current "next to paste" item highlighted with bioluminescent glow
Items already pasted fade to lower opacity but remain visible (with checkmark or "used" indicator)
Controls in Panel:


Drag handles on each item for reordering
"Flip Order" button (icon: vertical arrows or tentacle flip symbol) to reverse entire sequence
Individual delete buttons per item
"Wash Queue" button to clear everything
"Exit Queue Mode" button
Optional: show keyboard shortcut hints
Thematic Elements :
Visual Language:


Connecting lines between items look like glowing tentacles (electric cyan)
Lines should pulse subtly or have a flowing gradient animation
When items are reordered, tentacles should animate smoothly to new positions
"Flip Order" animation: tentacles twist/rotate as items flip
Animations:


Adding to queue: Item flows in from top with tentacle extending from previous item
Pasting: Item dissolves/fades with its tentacle retracting
Reordering: Smooth fluid motion like tentacles moving through water
Flip: Whole queue rotates 180° with elegant easing
Terminology:


Feature name: "Queue" for clarity
Clear all: "Wash Queue"
Status: "X items queued" or "Queue empty"
Settings Integration:
Keyboard Shortcut:


Default: Cmd+Shift+C to activate Queue mode
Fully customizable in app preferences
Prevent conflicts with system shortcuts
Option to toggle Queue mode on/off vs. hold-to-activate
Queue Preferences:


Auto-clear queue after all items pasted (on/off)
Keep pasted items visible in queue window (on/off)
Queue window default position
Maximum queue size limit (optional)
Technical Requirements:
State Management:


Track Queue mode active/inactive state
Maintain ordered list of queued items
Track which items have been pasted
Persist queue across app restarts (optional)
Window Management:


NSPanel or floating NSWindow for the queue preview
Always-on-top behavior (.floatingPanel window level)
Draggable anywhere on screen
Remembers position between sessions
Smooth show/hide animations
Clipboard Integration:


Intercept copy operations when Queue mode is active
Manage paste operations to pull from queue instead of system clipboard
Update system clipboard with next queue item on paste
Handle edge cases (queue empty, app in background, etc.)
Performance:


Smooth drag-and-drop reordering even with many items
Efficient rendering of tentacle connection lines
No lag when adding items to queue
Implementation Plan:
Please read my existing project to understand the current architecture, then:
Add Queue mode state management and keyboard shortcut handling
Create the floating queue preview window with basic layout
Implement queue building (capturing copies while in Queue mode)
Implement queue pasting (consuming items in sequence)
Add drag-and-drop reordering
Add "Flip Order" functionality
Apply Aurelia theming (tentacle lines, animations, colors)
Add settings panel for customization
Polish animations and edge cases
Start with the core behavior first, then add the visual flourishes and Aurelia theme elements.
