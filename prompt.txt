great! now here is a feature spec. also i have an app icon and a menu icon in my downloads folder. i want the app named Aurelia.
Now I want to add the following features:
Core Features to Implement:

Search functionality - Add an intelligent search bar that filters clipboard history in real-time. Should search across text content, and potentially support filtering by content type.
Content previews - Enhance the existing cards with better visual previews:

Large, clear text previews
Image thumbnails for copied images
Link previews with metadata if possible
File icons/names for copied files


Privacy controls - Add a system to ignore/exclude certain apps from clipboard tracking. Should include:

Settings panel to add apps to an ignore list
Common password managers pre-configured (1Password, LastPass, Keychain Access, etc.)
Option to pause clipboard monitoring entirely


Pinboards/Collections - Let users save frequently used items:

Create named collections
Star/favorite items to keep them permanently
Organize items into custom groups


Format control - When pasting, give options to:

Paste as plain text (strip all formatting)
Keep original formatting
Maybe a quick toggle or modifier key


Content type filtering - Add UI to filter history by type:

All items
Text only
Images only
Links only
Files only



UI/UX Elements:

Menu bar integration - Add a menu bar icon (use a placeholder/generic icon for now like a clipboard symbol). Clicking it should:

Show a dropdown with recent items
Provide quick access to open the main app
Show app preferences/settings option


Context menus - Right-click on clipboard items should show options:

Copy to clipboard
Delete item
Add to collection/favorite
Copy as plain text
View full content


Dark mode support - Ensure the app looks good in both light and dark modes with proper color adaptation
Clean, minimal design - Keep the interface unobtrusive and visually appealing with:

Good spacing and padding
Clear typography
Smooth transitions/animations
Visual hierarchy that makes scanning easy
